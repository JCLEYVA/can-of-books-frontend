## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

## Credit and Collaborations
**Logistical**
We will be available to communicate from 9am to 6pm on weekdays, and from 10am to 4pm on weekends.
We will use Slack and Remo for communication and screen sharing.
We will take 10-minute breaks every 2 hours.
If we start to fall behind, we will immediately communicate the issue and create a plan to catch up. We will prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency.

**Cooperative**
We will utilize Jeanette strengths in developing the Front end database, while Coriana will focus on developing the back-end components.
We both want to develop greater strength in testing and debugging.
We will pair program and use the driver-navigator method to ensure that both of us are involved in the development process and understand the code.

**Conflict Resolution**
If one person is pulling all the weight, we will have an honest conversation and identify the root cause of the issue. We will come up with a plan to distribute tasks more evenly and hold each other accountable.
If one person is taking over the project, we will have a discussion and clarify our roles and responsibilities. We will encourage open communication and respect each other's opinions and ideas.
We will approach each other with empathy and understanding, and recognize that we both have different skill levels and learning styles. We will work together to fill any knowledge gaps and provide support and guidance when needed.
